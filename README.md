### abstract
The motivation behind this study is to explore the importance of disruption time in public transport network resilience, and how to measure the changing impact over time. We have proposed a methodology to create a non-cascading time-dependent network model, estimating changing passenger loads in a public transport network. Our models, created using empirical passenger data from the London Underground, show that the network is not only most vulnerable during peak-hours to increased passenger loads, but in addition, the impact disruptions on the network change and the highest during peak-hours at certain locations. One of the goals of this research was to explore the topological metrics which identify time-dependent critical network links. In this study, betweenness has shown to be a valuable indicator of link criticality using our model approach. Considering capacity utilization as an important performance metric, disruptions of high-impact non-bridge links showed a small decrease in capacity utilization in preceding and succeeding links and a more significant increase in capacity utilization for parallel links. This parallel effect was less significant in terms of capacity utilization for non-bridge links which have a low betweenness centrality, instead effecting the capacity utilization of neighboring links in a more diffuse manner. Finally, we expected to see a spatial change in the effect of disruption events over time, but the analysis of our model results did not reflect this expectation. The results primed exciting directions for future research, and has given us valuable initial insights on time dependency of public transport resilience.

## Data

## Scripts
In fileloader.py, logic is written to quickly load and pre-format the xlsx files from the TFL London Data. 
For example: 
```python
def get_loads(): #pre-formating for easier use
    load = pd.read_excel(r'../data/NUMBAT/FRIDAY/2018FRI_Link_Load.xlsx',
         sheet_name='2018FRI_Link_Load')
    load.columns = load.iloc[1] 
    load = load[2:]
    return load
```

Additionally, The pickle libarary is used to save and load load in the Pickle directory, since certain calculations can take a long time.

Passengers traveling through the network model are assigned the links between their origin-destination according to the shortest path between those nodes, weighed on 'time'. NetworkX's built in shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra) is used: 

```python 
def create_shortest_paths(graph, OD):
    """
    Calculate shortest paths for each O-D pair in the OD matrix, where possible. 
    """
    paths = {}
    for od_id, od in OD.iterrows():
        origin = od['Origin Station Name']
        destination = od['Destination Station Name']
        try:             
            path = nx.shortest_path(graph, origin, destination, weight='time') 
        except nx.NetworkXNoPath: 
            path = []
        except nx.NodeNotFound:
            path = []
        paths.update({(origin, destination): path})
    return paths
```

When disrupting (effectively removing) a link, the shortest path needs to be updated according to the new network topology: 

``` python
def update_shortest_paths(basegraph, removed_edge, baseshortest):
    tempgraph = copy.deepcopy(basegraph) #prevent changes to original copy of graph
    tempgraph.remove_edge(removed_edge[0], removed_edge[1])
    newshort = copy.deepcopy(baseshortest) #new shortest paths dict
    """
    First, we check if the removed edge is in any of the paths in the base shortest path dict.
    If it is, we then re-calculate the shortest path using the new topology. This is not
    always possible, in which case an empty path is saved for the origin-destination pair. 
    """
    for key in newshort:
        path = newshort.get(key)
        for i in range(len(path)-1): #if the removed edge pair is in the shortest path, recalculate it. 
            if (([removed_edge[1], removed_edge[0]] == path[i:i+2]) 
                or [removed_edge[0], removed_edge[1]] == path[i:i+2]):
                try:
                    newpath = nx.shortest_path(tempgraph, key[0], key[1], weight='time')
                except nx.NetworkXNoPath: 
                    newpath = []
                    print('no new path found')
                except nx.NodeNotFound:
                    newpath = []
                    print('node not found')
                newshort.update({key: newpath})
    return newshort
```
Arguably the most important function - adding passenger load and travel times, is shown below. It is fairly straightforward, as it iterates through the od-matrix to grab the passengers required to be added per origin-destination pair, after which it iterates through the respective links of the shortest path from that o-d pair. 
```python
def add_passengers_time(pgraph, OD, timeslot, paths): 
    """Adds estimates of passenger loads to a graph using origin-destination pairs and their respective shortest paths

    Keyword arguments:
    pgraph -- the graph to add passenger and traveltime attribute to
    OD -- London Underground OD matrix from TFL 
    timeslot - timeslot from OD matrix columns
    paths - shortest path - precaculated to improve performance
    """
    nx.set_edge_attributes(pgraph, 0, 'passengers')
    nx.set_edge_attributes(pgraph, 0, 'traveltime')
    nx.set_edge_attributes(pgraph, timeslot, 'timeslot')
    passengersAdded = 0
    passengersNotAdded = 0
    for od_id, od in OD.iterrows():
        origin = od['Origin Station Name']
        destination = od['Destination Station Name']
        passengers = int(od[timeslot])
        if paths.get((origin, destination)) is not None: #is there a shortest path to be found?
            path = paths.get((origin, destination))
        else: #if not, continue (no passengers can be added)
            passengersNotAdded += passengers
            print(origin, destination)
            continue
        
        if len(path) == 0:  #an empty path array indicates that no shortest path was found, and passengers can't be added
            print(origin, destination, passengers)
            passengersNotAdded += passengers
            continue
        passengersAdded += passengers
        for i in range(len(path)-1): 
            pgraph[path[i]][path[i+1]]['passengers'] += passengers #adding passengers
            pgraph[path[i]][path[i+1]]['traveltime'] += passengers * int(pgraph[path[i]][path[i+1]]['time']) #adding total travel time
            
    print('Added passengers for timeslot: {}, total rows: {}'.format(timeslot, len(OD)))
    return (pgraph, {'passadd':passengersAdded, 'passnotadd':passengersNotAdded})
```

This form of trip assignment is an all-or-nothing approach similar to prior research [(Gautheir et al., 2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0361198118792115?journalCode=trra). An alternative form of trip assignment was considered, but was quite computationaly heavy. In this case, an exponential disribution was used in order to assign passengers to n shortest possible paths between their origin and destination: 

```python
def nshortestpaths(graph, origin, destination, npath=3):
    #First, create a generator item for n shortest paths
    pathgen = nx.shortest_simple_paths(graph, source=origin, target=destination, weight='time') 
    #Next, return the n shortest paths in a list
    return [next(pathgen) for i in range(npath) if next(pathgen) is not None] 
```
Next, the trip assignment was changed in order to distribute the passengers over the shortest paths: 

```python
def trip_assigment(graph, paths, passengers):
    npaths = len(paths)

    e = 2.5 #exponential distribution to follow
    #create exponential distribution to assign passengers to:
    dist = [e**i/(sum([e**j for j in range(npaths)])) for i in range(npaths)][::-1] 
    for i in range(npaths):
        path = paths[i]
        npass = int(dist[i] * passengers)
        for i in range(len(path)-1): 
            graph[path[i]][path[i+1]]['passengers'] += npass #adding passengers
            graph[path[i]][path[i+1]]['traveltime'] += npass * int(graph[path[i]][path[i+1]]['time']) 

    return graph
```

## Modelling
In certain (late) timeslots, due to very low train frequency, capacity is at 0. This skews results, therefore we iteratively take the average capacity of neighbouring links which sligtly increases average capacity, but allows for better analysis of results: 
```python
def fixCapacity(bgraph, depth):
    depth += 1 #keep track of depth to prevent stack overflow
    #create a list of edges with no capacity
    nocap = [(a, b) for a, b, data in bgraph.edges(data=True) 
        if data['capacity'] == 0] 

    for start, end in nocap:
        sneighbors = [n for n in bgraph.neighbors(start)] 
        eneighbors = [n for n in bgraph.neighbors(end)]
        #average of neighbours at start of link
        savg = sum(bgraph[s][start]['capacity'] 
            for s in sneighbors)/len(sneighbors) 

        #average of neighbours at end of link
        eavg = sum(bgraph[e][end]['capacity'] 
            for e in eneighbors)/len(sneighbors) 

        bgraph[start][end]['capacity'] = (savg + eavg)//2
    if depth > 100: #if it doesn't converge at 100 iterations, stop
        print('no solution found')
        return
    if len(nocap) > 0: 
        fixCapacity(bgraph, depth)
    return
```

In the file 01- intial pickled models, the shortest paths are calculated and trip assignment is performed. In my actual research, I ended up uploading part of the code to AWS in order to let it run overnight, as the calculations were quite heavy. The code run on AWS is as follows: 

```python
import os.path
from os import path
import networkx as nx
import scripts2 as scr
import fileloader as fl
import dataframes as df
import time

graph = fl.get_network()
basegraphs = fl.load_obj('basegraphs')
od = fl.get_OD_LU()
for edge in graph.edges():
    starttime = time.time()
    edge = list(graph.edges())[i]
    name = ",".join(edge)
    if path.exists('Pickles/test/'+ name + '.pickle'): continue #if I already created this file, skip 
    tempshortest = fl.load_obj(name, 'shortest/')
    tempgraphs, passengers = scr.n1_analysis(basegraphs, od, tempshortest, edge)
    fl.save_obj(tempgraphs, name, 'awsgraphs/')
    fl.save_obj(passengers, name, 'passengers/')
    print('added for edge: {}, time taken {}'.format(name, starttime-time.time()))
```
