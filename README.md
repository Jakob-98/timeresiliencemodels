# Proposing a repoducible method of creating time resilience models in Python using NetworkX
This repo is used to showcase the methodology used in my thesis "Assessing time resilience of public transit networks using London Underground data". The motivation behind this study was to explore the importance of disruption time in public transport network resilience, and how to measure the changing impact over time. Here you can find a methodology to model a non-cascading time-dependent network model, estimating changing passenger loads in a public transport network.

## Data

## Scripts
In fileloader.py, logic is written to quickly load and pre-format the xlsx files from the TFL London Data. 
For example: 
```python
def get_loads(): #pre-formating for easier use
    load = pd.read_excel(r'../data/NUMBAT/FRIDAY/2018FRI_Link_Load.xlsx',
         sheet_name='2018FRI_Link_Load')
    load.columns = load.iloc[1] 
    load = load[2:]
    return load
```

Additionally, The pickle libarary is used to save and load load in the Pickle directory, since certain calculations can take a long time.

Passengers traveling through the network model are assigned the links between their origin-destination according to the shortest path between those nodes, weighed on 'time'. NetworkX's built in shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra) is used: 

```python 
def create_shortest_paths(graph, OD):
    """
    Calculate shortest paths for each O-D pair in the OD matrix, where possible. 
    """
    paths = {}
    for od_id, od in OD.iterrows():
        origin = od['Origin Station Name']
        destination = od['Destination Station Name']
        try:             
            path = nx.shortest_path(graph, origin, destination, weight='time') 
        except nx.NetworkXNoPath: 
            path = []
        except nx.NodeNotFound:
            path = []
        paths.update({(origin, destination): path})
    return paths
```

When disrupting (effectively removing) a link, the shortest path needs to be updated according to the new network topology: 

``` python
def update_shortest_paths(basegraph, removed_edge, baseshortest):
    tempgraph = copy.deepcopy(basegraph) #prevent changes to original copy of graph
    tempgraph.remove_edge(removed_edge[0], removed_edge[1])
    newshort = copy.deepcopy(baseshortest) #new shortest paths dict
    """
    First, we check if the removed edge is in any of the paths in the base shortest path dict.
    If it is, we then re-calculate the shortest path using the new topology. This is not
    always possible, in which case an empty path is saved for the origin-destination pair. 
    """
    for key in newshort:
        path = newshort.get(key)
        for i in range(len(path)-1): #if the removed edge pair is in the shortest path, recalculate it. 
            if (([removed_edge[1], removed_edge[0]] == path[i:i+2]) 
                or [removed_edge[0], removed_edge[1]] == path[i:i+2]):
                try:
                    newpath = nx.shortest_path(tempgraph, key[0], key[1], weight='time')
                except nx.NetworkXNoPath: 
                    newpath = []
                    print('no new path found')
                except nx.NodeNotFound:
                    newpath = []
                    print('node not found')
                newshort.update({key: newpath})
    return newshort
```

This form of trip assignment is an all-or-nothing approach similar to prior research [(Gautheir et al., 2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0361198118792115?journalCode=trra). An alternative form of trip assignment was considered, but was quite computationaly heavy. In this case, an exponential disribution was used in order to assign passengers to n shortest possible paths between their origin and destination: 

```python
def nshortestpaths(graph, origin, destination, npath=3):
    #First, create a generator item for n shortest paths
    pathgen = nx.shortest_simple_paths(graph, source=origin, target=destination, weight='time') 
    #Next, return the n shortest paths in a list
    return [next(pathgen) for i in range(npath) if next(pathgen) is not None] 
```
Next, the trip assignment was changed in order to distribute the passengers over the shortest paths: 

```python
def trip_assigment(graph, paths, passengers):
    npaths = len(paths)

    e = 2.5 #exponential distribution to follow
    #create exponential distribution to assign passengers to:
    dist = [e**i/(sum([e**j for j in range(npaths)])) for i in range(npaths)][::-1] 
    for i in range(npaths):
        path = paths[i]
        npass = int(dist[i] * passengers)
        for i in range(len(path)-1): 
            graph[path[i]][path[i+1]]['passengers'] += npass #adding passengers
            graph[path[i]][path[i+1]]['traveltime'] += npass * int(graph[path[i]][path[i+1]]['time']) 

    return graph
```

## Modelling
In certain (late) timeslots, due to very low train frequency, capacity is at 0. This skews results, therefore we iteratively take the average capacity of neighbouring links which sligtly increases average capacity, but allows for better analysis of results: 
```python
def fixCapacity(bgraph, depth):
    depth += 1 #keep track of depth to prevent stack overflow
    #create a list of edges with no capacity
    nocap = [(a, b) for a, b, data in bgraph.edges(data=True) 
        if data['capacity'] == 0] 

    for start, end in nocap:
        sneighbors = [n for n in bgraph.neighbors(start)] 
        eneighbors = [n for n in bgraph.neighbors(end)]
        #average of neighbours at start of link
        savg = sum(bgraph[s][start]['capacity'] 
            for s in sneighbors)/len(sneighbors) 

        #average of neighbours at end of link
        eavg = sum(bgraph[e][end]['capacity'] 
            for e in eneighbors)/len(sneighbors) 

        bgraph[start][end]['capacity'] = (savg + eavg)//2
    if depth > 100: #if it doesn't converge at 100 iterations, stop
        print('no solution found')
        return
    if len(nocap) > 0: 
        fixCapacity(bgraph, depth)
    return
```
